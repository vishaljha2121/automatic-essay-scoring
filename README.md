## About The Project



### Built With

- **Word Vectorisation**.
- **Sequantial DenseNet**

The loss value of **1.5290** has been achieved which gives fair results but the model is not generalised to its full potential given the processing constraints.


Model evaluation resulted in average prediction accuracy score of 0.6441.
